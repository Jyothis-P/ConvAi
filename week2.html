 		<h1 class="mainhead">Analysis of current scenario</h1>
 		<p class="subbody"> We investigated the technical difficulties and technical assistance the blind people experienced with computers and computing applications.
 Today's society is one that depends heavily on technology, particularly the use of computers. From banking to sending a basic email, computers have become quintessential part of our lifes.
</p>
		<h1 class="subhead">Method</h1>
 		<p class="subbody"> We visited a local Blind and Handicapped school. We also contacted adults who had no remaining functional vision. The questions focused on frequency, nature and cause of issues.<br>
Conclusions: We noticed that most of the issues that were observed in both adults and students were mostly similar barring that student mostly faced issued with getting used to some technologies and the learning curve involved with it.
</p>
		<h1 class="subhead">Results</h1>
 		<p class="subbody">
The majority of participants reported that change in Operating systems, updates and change of environments required huge learning curve.
Most people relied on tech support whenever they got stuck, and tech support relied on UI elements ( example: the blue bar on top in the browser) which are oten hard and confusing to understand. 
With current TTS(Text-to-Speech) softwares, they can deal with most of the text online. But the problem arises when dealing with non-textual content such as images and pdfs. 

		</p>
		<h1 class="subhead">Conclusion</h1>
 		<p class="subbody">
We found that most of the solutions that exist or are to be added are fundamentally flawed. What they should have is not a way to navigate systems that were never meant to be used by them, but a complete reboot resulting in a system desgined for them.
In conclusion, we think that technology is not even in earshot of where it needs to be in terms of usability by blind and handicapped people. This is not for the lack of trying. But because of the selfish nature of the routes we have taken so far. This has also brought to our attention the need for a proper method to ‘translate’ non-textual media in a way that the visually impaired can also use.
